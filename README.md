# Password-Manager

**Overview :**

Created a GUI using Tkinter, this application allows you to generate secure passwords for your accounts and store them easily. The passwords are stored in a JSON file on your local machine, ensuring no external access and maintaining your privacy. Additionally, the credentials are also stored in an Excel file for redundancy and ease of access.
